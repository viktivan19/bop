# Bop
bop.ai is a music generation framework specialised in creating short and catchy melodies

In this repo you'll find two main scripts:
- model_script.py: This script contains all the data processing, model training, music generation and post processing 
- analyse_survey_results.py: This script contains all the results analysis and data visualisations

All the training data sits in the data_final folder but these are not pushed to the repo for licensing reasons
